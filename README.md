# Recipes

Check out my website at **https://harirathod.github.io/odin-recipes/** !

This simple website _(the first website I've ever made)_ provides recipes for a couple of dishes. The website was created using **HTML** and **CSS**, which was learned by working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).
