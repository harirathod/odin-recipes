# Recipes

Check out my website at **https://harirathod.github.io/recipes-website/** !

Made using **HTML** and **CSS**, this simple website _(the first website I've ever made)_ provides recipes for a couple of dishes. 

###### The website was created whilst learning through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).
